08.02.23: Started cpp from scratch (kinda)
  I started a course from scratch to deepen my knowledge of cpp.
  It's not advanced cpp, just cpp covered in a deeper way.
  This will enable me to fill in the gaps from my chaotic style of learning.

  Learned the structure of C++ files, preprocessing, variables/constants, arrays/vectors,
  statements and operators.
