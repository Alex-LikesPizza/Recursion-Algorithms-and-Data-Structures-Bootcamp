02.08.23: Started cpp from scratch (kinda)
  I started a course from scratch to deepen my knowledge of cpp.
  It's not advanced cpp, just cpp covered in a deeper way.
  This will enable me to fill in the gaps from my chaotic style of learning.

  Learned: Structure of C++, preprocessing, variables/constants, arrays/vectors,
           statements and operators.
