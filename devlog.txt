08.02.23: Started cpp from scratch (kinda)
  I started a course from scratch to deepen my knowledge of cpp.
  It's not advanced cpp, just cpp covered in a deeper way.
  This will enable me to fill in the gaps from my chaotic style of learning.

  Learned: Structure of C++, preprocessing, variables/constants, arrays/vectors,
           statements and operators.
02.03.23:
  Did some reorganizing.

  Learned:
  C++ Loops
    for loops
    for-range loops
    while
    do-while
    break
    continue

  Strings.
    C-style trings
    C++ strings
    cctype library
    cstring library
    string library
