08.02.23: Started cpp from scratch (kinda)
  I started a course from scratch to deepen my knowledge of cpp.
  It's not advanced cpp, just cpp covered in a deeper way.
  This will enable me to fill in the gaps from my chaotic style of learning.

  Learned the structure of C++ files, preprocessing, variables/constants, arrays/vectors,
  statements and operators.

  Did some reorganizing.

  C++ Loops:
    for loops
    for-range loops
    while
    do-while
    break
    continue

  Strings:
    C-style trings
    C++ strings
    cctype library
    cstring library
    string library

  Functions:
    structure
    overloading
    prototypes
    constant parameters
    default parameter value
    using functions
